Fagioli all’Uccelletto Vegan Tuscan Beans in Tomato Sauce Ingredients:
1 cup Tomato Passata
1 Small Spanish Onion finely chopped
1/4 cup Olive Oil
1 tbsp Dried Sage
5 Garlic Cloves minced
19 oz Canned Cannellini Beans
Kosher Salt & Pepper
1 tbsp Parsley chopped

Fagioli all’Uccelletto Vegan Tuscan Beans in Tomato Sauce Instructions:
Warm half the olive oil in a saute pan over medium low heat. Add the onions, stir and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Crush the dried sage between your fingers and add to the pan.
Stir in the garlic then raise the heat slightly and stir for 2-3 minutes.
Reduce the heat to low and add the rest of the olive oil and beans, with most of their cooking liquid. Add the passata and add any water needed to ensure the beans are covered completely. Bring to a slow simmer and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature, uncovered. About 10 minutes before serving, reheat the beans, stirring gently once or twice over low heat. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Garnish with the remaining olive oil and chopped parsley. Serve with crusty bread, pasta or polenta.
