Steamed Fish With Lime and Garlic Ingredients:
    35 ounces fish (tilapia)
    5.5 tablespoons lime
    5 tablespoons fish sauce
    1 tablespoon palm sugar (chop to measure)
    10 cloves garlic (pounded)
    10 chilies (pounded)
    1⁄3 cup coriander (chopped)
    2 coriander root (pounded)
    1⁄3 cup celery (chopped)
    2 lemongrass (cut in 2 or 3 pieces)

Steamed Fish With Lime and Garlic Instructions:
    Make sure the fish is cleaned thoroughly. Slice 3–4 cuts into the fish on both sides.
    Stuff the belly of the fish with the lemongrass.
    Place the fish in a steamer, and steam for 10–15 minutes, depending on the size of the fish. Ideally, you want to lay the fish on top of a dish.
    Pound garlic, coriander root, and chilies in a mortar and pestle.
    Add palm sugar, fish sauce, fresh lime juice and mix into 1 sauce.
    After steaming, transfer to a serving dish and top with the sauce, then garnish with coriander and celery. Serve immediately, with a portion of rice.
