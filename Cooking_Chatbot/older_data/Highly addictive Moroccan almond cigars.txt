Highly addictive Moroccan almond cigar Instructions:
Mix ground almonds, melted butter/margarine, sugar, and cinnamon in a big bowl. Gradually add rose water until the mixture is soft.
Put a sheet of brick/egg roll wrapper on a flat surface. Spoon a small amount of the mix onto one side, brush egg white on the other sides. Roll the wrapper tightly around the mixture, pressing down on the seam to form a cigar.
Heat vegetable oil in a pan. Fry the cigars for 5-6 min on each side until golden.
Let the cigars cool, then roll them in honey on a plate. Serve with warm Moroccan tea.
