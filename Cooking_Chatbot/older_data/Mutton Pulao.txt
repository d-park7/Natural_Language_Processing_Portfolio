Mutton Pulao Instructions:
    In a bowl cover the rice completely with cold water and leave it to soak for a minimum of 1 hour.
    Whilst the rice is soaking in a large pot add the lamb stock ingredients along with your choice of meat (mutton or lamb) then add the water and cook for 40-45 minutes until the meat has softened – mutton meat may take longer.
    When the mutton is almost done cooking, heat up the oil in a separate pot on medium heat then add the finely sliced onions and cook for 4-5 minutes until softened and browned – once lightly browned add 1 tablespoon of water to release the colour from the onions.
    Remove the lamb pieces from the other pot and add to the onions along with the garlic paste, salt, and green chillies then cook for 7-8 minutes.
    Meanwhile, sieve the stock then add the lamb stock into the lamb and cook for another 5 minutes.
    Drain the soaked rice and add it to the pan then gently mix before cooking on high heat for 10-15 minutes or until the water has almost dried up.
    Reduce the heat to low then cover with a lid and cook for 10-15.
    Serve immediately with raita and enjoy!
