Miso-Glazed Asparagus and Pearl Onions Ingredients:
    8 ounces red pearl onions
    1 tablespoon neutral oil
    2 tablespoons plant-based butter (or use dairy if not vegan)
    2 tablespoons red or white miso paste*
    1 tablespoon brown sugar
    2 teaspoons rice vinegar
    2 teaspoons light soy sauce
    1 teaspoon chili oil
    1 pound asparagus, woody ends removed
    Salt to taste
    Sliced scallions and sesame seeds, optional, for garnish


Miso-Glazed Asparagus and Pearl Onions Instructions:
    Prep the pearl onions:
    Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add the pearl onions and cook for 3 minutes. Drain and immediately transfer to an ice bath. Once the onions are cool to handle, carefully snip off a sliver of the root end using sharp scissors. Squeeze the top of the onion to pop the onion from its skin. Continue until all the onions are peeled.
    Fry the onions:
    Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and sauté for 15 minutes, turning occasionally, until they begin to brown and soften. Season with salt.
    Prepare the sauce:
    Microwave 2 tablespoons plant-based butter in a bowl until melted. Add the miso paste, brown sugar, rice vinegar, light soy sauce, and chili oil and whisk until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference.
    Cook the asparagus:
    Add the asparagus spears to the skillet with the onions. Cook for 5 minutes until almost fork-tender.
    Finish the miso-glazed asparagus:
    Pour in the miso glaze and turn the heat to medium-high. As soon as it begins to bubble, reduce heat and simmer for 5–7 minutes or until the glaze thickens and the asparagus is fork-tender and bright green. Taste and season. Turn off the heat.
    To serve:
    Arrange the asparagus and red onions on a serving platter. Garnish with sesame seeds and sliced scallions. Enjoy!
