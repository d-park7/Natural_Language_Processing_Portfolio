1 tbsp lemon zest

Almond Flour Blueberry Muffins Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 400 and line 9 cups of a muffin tin with parchment paper liners. 2. Leaving a few cups empty helps to circulate the heat so the muffins rise.
In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the almond flour, baking soda, salt, and coconut sugar. Set aside.
In another small mixing bowl, beat the eggs then stir in the oil, lemon zest, and vanilla.
Pour the egg mixture over the almond flour mixture and stir until just combined. Don't overmix the batter.
Add the blueberries to the batter and gently fold them in.
Scoop the muffin batter into the 9 prepared muffin cups.
Bake at 400 for 5 minutes then turn the heat down to 375 and bake for 13-15 minutes more. Watch for the tops to be lightly browned and spring back when lightly pressed with a finger.
Let the muffins cool in the pan for 5 minutes then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
