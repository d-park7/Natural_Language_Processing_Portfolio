Irresistible Arabic Beehive Sweet Buns Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup warm water
1/4 cup milk
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 egg
1/4 cup honey
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 tablespoon warm water
Sesame seeds, for garnish

Irresistible Arabic Beehive Sweet Buns Instructions:
Dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup warm water and allow approximately 5 minutes for it to become frothy. This can be done by placing the mixture in a small bowl.
In the same mixing bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, salt and baking powder carefully until blended.
Mix together the yeast mixture, milk, vegetable oil, and egg in a bowl to create a soft dough.
Knead the dough for approximately 5-7 minutes, turning it out onto a floured surface, until its texture becomes smooth and elastic.
Cover the dough in a greased bowl using a damp cloth, and place in a warm spot. Allow it to rest for an hour - or until it's doubled in size.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Melt the butter and honey in a small saucepan over low heat, then remove from the heat and stir in 1 tablespoon of warm water. The process concludes with a fully-blended mix of butter, honey, and water.
Divide the dough into small portions equivalent in size to a golf ball; you will usually get between 16-18 balls.
Roll the dough balls into 6-inch-long ropes.
Take each rope, fold it in half, and create a spiral shape like a beehive. Twist the rope around itself and pinch the end to seal it.
Using parchment paper to line a baking sheet, position the beehive buns in a way that leaves an adequate amount of space between each one.
Glaze each bun with the honey butter, then top them off with a sprinkle of sesame seeds.
Preheat the oven, then put the buns in to bake for 15-20 minutes or until they reach a golden-brown color.
Remove the buns from the oven when done cooking and set them on a wire rack to cool for a few minutes. Then they'll be ready to serve!
