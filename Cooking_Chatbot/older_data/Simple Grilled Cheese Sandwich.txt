Grilled Cheese Sandwich Ingredients:
    2 slices of bread
    2 slices of cheddar cheese
    1 tablespoon of butter

Grilled Cheese Sandwich Instructions:
    Preheat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat.
    Spread butter on one side of each slice of bread.
    Place one slice of cheese on one of the bread slices (on the unbuttered side), and then top it with the other slice of cheese and the other bread slice (buttered side up).
    Place the sandwich on the preheated pan and cook for 2-3 minutes until the bottom slice of bread is golden brown.
    Flip the sandwich over and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the other side is golden brown and the cheese is melted.
    Remove the sandwich from the pan, cut it in half if desired, and serve hot.
