Spanakorizo Ingredients:
    2 tbsp Butter
    10 oz Baby Spinach
    2 tbsp Olive Oil
    2 Medium Shallots thinly sliced
    Kosher Salt & Black Pepper
    1.5 cups Long Grain White Rice rinsed and drained
    1 lb Large Shrimp peeled
    1 cup Fresh Dill chopped
    1 tsp Grated Lemon Zest
    3 tbsp Lemon Juice
    1/4 cup Feta Cheese crumbled

Spanakorizo Instructions:
    In a large saucepan over medium-high, heat the butter until bubbling. Add the spinach and cook, stirring, until wilted but still bright green, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl, including any liquid released by the spinach; set aside.
    Set the same pan over medium-high. Add the oil, shallots and 1/2 tsp salt, then cook, stirring often, until the shallots are translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the rice, 2.5 cups of water, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper. Stir to combine, then bring to a boil. Cover, reduce to low and cook until the liquid has been absorbed, 15 to 18 minutes.
    Meanwhile, season the shrimp with salt and pepper.
    When the rice is done, remove the pan from the heat. Quickly and evenly scatter the shrimp over the surface, re-cover and let stand for 10 minutes. Using a fork, fluff the rice and fold in the shrimp. Re-cover and let stand until the shrimp are opaque throughout, another 5 to 7 minutes.
    Add the spinach with its liquid, the dill and the lemon zest and juice, then fold until well combined. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
    Top with crumbled feta cheese and serve hot.
