1/2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
1 tsp sugar
1 tsp active dry yeast
120ml warm milk
2 tbsp vegetable oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped
2 tbsp butter, melted

Garlic Naan Bread Instructions:
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, and yeast.
Add in the warm milk in small increments and vegetable oil, and mix well to form a soft dough. Knead the dough for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
Cover the dough with a damp cloth and leave it to rest for about 30 minutes in a warm place.
Preheat your grill to high heat.
In a small bowl, mix together the minced garlic, chopped coriander, and melted butter.
Divide the dough into 4 equal parts, and roll each part out into a thin circle.
Brush the garlic and coriander butter over one side of each naan.
Place the naans buttered side up on the grill, and cook for about 2-3 minutes, or until the naans start to puff up and turn golden brown.
Flip the naans over and cook for another 1-2 minutes, or until the other side is also golden brown.
Remove the naans from the grill and serve hot.
