Vegan Puerto Rican Rice Ingredients: 
    1 can Pigeon Peas
    3 cups Rice
    3 tbsp Tomato Paste
    3 tsp Sazon
    1/2 tsp Adobo
    8 tbsp Recaito
    3 tbsp Coconut Oil
    5 Leaves Bay Leaves
    1/2 tsp Oregano
    1/8 tsp Salt
    1 tbsp Lemon Juice
    3 cups Low-Sodium Vegetable Broth
    10 whole Green Olives Optional
    1/2 bunch Cilantro Optional

Vegan Puerto Rican Rice Instructions:
    Rinse the rice using a fine mesh strainer and set it to the side.
    Place the cast iron pot on the stovetop and set it to medium-high heat. Add the coconut oil and sofrito, and cook for roughly 2-3 minutes, stirring carefully.
    Add all the spices and tomato paste and stir for 4 minutes.
    Add the canned gandules (pigeon peas) with the liquid and green olives (optional) and cook for 8-10 minutes. Continue to stir until the gandules are slightly al dente.
    Mix in the rice, and stir until the rice is well mixed and coated in the tomato paste sauce. Then add the broth and a drop of lemon juice and continue cooking at medium-high heat until the water evaporates.
    Once the water has evaporated, reduce to very low heat and cook for 25 minutes with the lid on. 
    After cooking for 25 minutes, keep the lid on, remove from heat, and let sit for 15-20 minutes.
    Rinse and chop cilantro, add to the cooked rice, and mix. Enjoy!
    Serve with a light salad with vinaigrette or a creamy vegan pasta salad.
