2 cups of grape tomatoes (halved, which weigh approximately 10 oz).
6 ounces of broccoli florets
5 to 6 cloves of garlic, minced
Extra Virgin Olive Oil

1 teaspoon of coriander
1 pound of salmon fillet without the skin

A salmon fillet with a Mediterranean kick Instructions:
Set the oven to 400°F prior to baking.
Mix together the potatoes, grape tomatoes, and broccoli in a big bowl. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of olive oil over the ingredients and toss to coat.
For seasoning, mix the veggies with salt and pepper, 1 tablespoon of minced garlic, 1 teaspoon of zaatar, and ½ teaspoon of coriander. Mix the ingredients together until all vegetables are coated evenly.
Move the vegetables onto a baking sheet and raise the edges.
To prepare the salmon, make sure to pat it dry and season it with salt and pepper. Then, pour some olive oil on top of it and spread the remaining garlic evenly. Finally, complete the dish by sprinkling zaatar and coriander over the fish.
Divide the salmon into 4 equal parts and arrange them with the vegetables on a baking sheet. Add additional olive oil as needed. Bake the salmon thoroughly and soften the vegetables, usually taking 15-16 minutes.
After cooking the salmon in the oven, take it out and squeeze some lemon juice over it. Top with more zaatar as a seasoning before serving.
Enjoy this delicious dish with Lebanese rice and a side salad of your choice.
