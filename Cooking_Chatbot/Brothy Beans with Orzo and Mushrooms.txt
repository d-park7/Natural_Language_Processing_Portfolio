Ingredients:

8 ounces mushrooms, sliced or torn depending on the variety
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 yellow onion, peeled and minced
A pinch of dry thyme, to taste
4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
Crushed red pepper to taste
1 tablespoon tomato paste, if you like it a bit thicker
15-ounce can cannellini beans
1 pint cherry tomatoes or use a 15-ounce can of diced tomatoes
4 cups water, plus more if needed
8 ounces orzo or other small pasta
10 basil leaves, roughly chopped; a few leaves reserved for garnish; optional
1 lemon, optional
Salt and pepper to taste

Cook the onion and mushrooms:

Place a pot on a burner over medium heat. Add the mushrooms to the dry pot and cook for 5–7 minutes until they begin to release excess water. Cook for an additional 5 minutes until lightly browned. Season with salt and pepper.
Add the 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil to the pot of mushrooms along with the diced onions. Cook for 5–7 minutes.
Add the thyme, garlic, and a big pinch of crushed red pepper to taste. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add tomato paste, if using, and cook for 1 minute.

Cook the beans and pasta:

Add the beans, tomatoes, and 4 cups water. Bring to a boil and season liberally with salt. Once boiling, add the orzo. Reduce heat to a low bowl (medium to medium-high, depending on your stove). Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 8–12 minutes until the orzo is al dente. Taste and season.
Add more water, if you like it a bit soupier.

Finish the beans:

Add the chopped basil and lemon juice to the pot. Turn off the heat.

To serve:

Divide the cooked beans and pasta between bowls. Serve with black pepper and more fresh basil, if you like.
