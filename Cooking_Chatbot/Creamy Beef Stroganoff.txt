Serves 2. Double ingredients for 4 servings.
Ingredients:
• 1 lb top sirloin steak, thinly sliced into strips
• 2 Tbsp olive oil
• 2 Tbsp unsalted butter
• 1/2 medium onion, finely chopped
• 1/2 lIb brown mushrooms, thickly sliced
• 1 garlic cloves, minced
• 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour
• 1 cup beef broth
• 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
• 1/4 cup sour cream
• 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
• 1/2 tsp dijon mustard
• 1/2 tsp salt
• 1/4 tsp black pepper
(To serve)
• 1 Tbsp green onion, to garnish
• 8-12 oz egg noodles, to serve
Instructions: 

Place a large deep pan or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add 2 Tbsp oil and once oil is very hot, add thinly sliced beef strips in a single layer, cooking 1 minute per side without stirring.
Cook until just browned and no longer red. Sear beef in 2 batches so you don't overcrowd the pan.
Remove beef to a plate and cover to keep warm.
Add 2 Tbsp butter, chopped onion and sliced mushrooms. Sautee 6-8 minutes or until liquid has evaporated and onions and mushrooms are soft and lightly browned.
Add 1 minced garlic clove and sautee 1 minute until fragrant. Add 1 Tbsp flour and sautee another minute stirring constantly.
Pour in 1 cups beef broth, scraping any bits from the bottom of the pan then add 3/4 cup whipping cream and simmer another 1 to 2 minutes or until slightly thickened.
Stir a few Tablespoons of the sauce into 1/4 cup of sour cream to temper it so the sour cream doesn't curdle then add it to the pan while stirring constantly.
Stir in 1 Tbsp Worcestershire, 1/2 tsp dijon mustard, and season with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper, or season to taste and continue simmering until sauce is creamy. Add beef with any accumulated juices back to the pan and bring just to a simmer or until beef is heated through.

Personal notes: While searing the sirloin strips, I lightly season it with salt and pepper, which adds more flavor to the beef. Rather than using 1/2 tsp salt in the sauce, I add just a couple dashes salt and pepper
