Ingredients:

1 lb of boneless and skinless chicken breasts cut into strips
1 lb of boneless and skinless chicken thighs
¼ cup of olive oil
3 tbsp of lemon juice 
6 minced garlic cloves
2 tsp of salt 
1 tsp of paprika 
¾ tsp of cardamom 
¾ tsp of cumin 
¼ tsp of crushed red pepper 
¼ tsp of cinnamon

Directions:

To make this chicken dish, start by mixing the marinade in a ziplock bag or container. If using a container, you may need to increase the marinade by 50%.
Add the chicken to the marinade and massage it from the outside to coat it well. Place the bag or container in the fridge to marinate for at least 3 hours, or up to 24 hours.
When you're ready to cook the chicken, you can do it on the stove or on a BBQ. The spices in the marinade will give the chicken a nice crust and a delicious aroma.
After cooking the chicken, let it rest for at least 3 minutes before slicing or serving. This will allow the juices to redistribute throughout the flesh, rather than running out when you cut into the meat.
To serve, place the chicken, lettuce, tomato slices, onion, yogurt sauce, and flatbreads on a platter. Allow everyone to make their own wraps with the ingredients. If the chicken is larger, you may want to slice it. If it is smaller, you can leave it whole. Enjoy!
