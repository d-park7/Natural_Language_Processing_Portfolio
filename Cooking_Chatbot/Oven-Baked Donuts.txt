Instructions: Here is the video recipe  ( Oven-Baked Donuts )
Donut Dough:

To make buttermilk: Mix white vinegar into milk, stir, then let it rest for 5-10 minutes until it becomes thick and curdled
Whisk together melted butter, oil, sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.
Add eggs one at a time, along with vanilla extract.
In a separate bowl, mix the smaller amount of flour with baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Add the dry mixture to the butter mixture in three parts, alternating with the milk. Start and finish with the dry ingredients.
If the mixture is too runny, add a little more flour.

Baking:

Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C) and grease a donut pan.
Pipe the batter into each donut mold, filling about 3/4 of the mold, leaving a little space at the top.
Bake for 10 minutes.
Allow the donuts to cool in the pan for a couple of minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack.
Let them cool down completely.

Glazing

In a large bowl, mix sugar, milk, and salt until smooth. To make the glaze thinner, add extra milk, just a teaspoon at a time.
Dip your donuts into the glaze and let them firm up.
