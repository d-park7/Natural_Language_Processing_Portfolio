Original Recipe: Oatmeal Creme Pie Cheesecake Recipe
Ingredients

11 Oatmeal Creme Pies (Big Size) 
24oz Cream Cheese, room temperature 
⅓ Cup Brown Sugar 
¼ Cup Granulated Sugar 
1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract 
¼ Cup Molasses 
2 teaspoons Pumpkin Pie Spice 
1 Cup Heavy Whipping Cream 
½ Cup Powdered Sugar 
¼ Cup Caramel Sauce, for serving

Instructions

Spray a 9" springform pan with cooking spray then line the bottom with parchment paper. Add a layer of Oatmeal Creme Pies to the bottom to act as the crust of the cheesecake (it took 6 big ones for me). 
Add the softened cream cheese, brown sugar, granulated sugar, vanilla, molasses and pumpkin pie spice to the bowl of a stand mixer and mix for about 1 minute until well mixed. 
In another large bowl beat the cream until soft peaks form, then add the powdered sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks have formed. 
Fold the cream into the cream cheese mixture. 
Pour this cream cheese mixture over the top of the oatmeal cookie crust. 
Spread out evenly then refrigerate for about 6 hours (I let mine refrigerate over night- which is best if you have time). 
After the oatmeal creme pie cheesecake has set, take about 2 more creme pies and chop into pieces then decorate the top of the cheesecake. 
When serving, drizzle with the caramel sauce (caramel syrup).
