Original Printable Recipe Here: Double Fudge Cake Mix Cookies
Ingredients:

1 box your preferred chocolate cake mix (I used Duncan Hines Dark Chocolate Fudge)
1/3 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1/2 cup dark chocolate chips

Instructions:

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. and line two baking trays with parchment paper. Set aside.
Sift cake mix into a bowl and mix then mix in oil and eggs. Once a sticky dough begins to form, add chocolate chips.
Using a cookie scooper or rounded tablespoon, drop cookie dough onto prepared baking sheets. Taking the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar, gently press down each cookie. Bake for 10 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack.
