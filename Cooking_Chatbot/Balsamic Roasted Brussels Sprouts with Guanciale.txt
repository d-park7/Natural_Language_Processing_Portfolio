Recipe here originally: Balsamic Roasted Brussels Sprouts

1 pound Brussels sprouts
1 shallot, peeled and sliced lengthwise into wedges
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 ounces guanciale
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon brown sugar
Salt and pepper to taste
Fresh basil leaves, optional, for serving

Prepare the Brussels sprouts:

Preheat oven to 400ºF.
Trim off the root end of the Brussels sprouts and remove any gnarly outer leaves. Then, halve the sprouts and set them aside.
Toss the halved sprouts and sliced shallot with olive oil on a baking sheet. Season all over with salt and pepper. Make sure the sprouts are cut-side down. Transfer to the oven for 8–10 minutes.

Cook the guanciale:

Remove the Brussels sprouts from the oven. Add the guanciale to the baking sheet and toss to combine. Return to the oven for an additional 8–10 minutes or until the sprouts are deeply roasted, and the guanciale is crisp.

Prepare the vinegar:

In a bowl, whisk together the balsamic vinegar and brown sugar. Set aside. Finish the Brussels sprouts:
Pour the balsamic vinegar mixture on the sprouts and toss to coat. Return to the oven for 3–5 minutes.

To serve:

Transfer the roasted Brussels sprouts to a serving bowl. Arrange fresh basil on top. Enjoy!
