Ingredients
    • 8 Eggs
    • 2 tbsp Sour Cream
    • 1/2 tsp Kosher Salt
    • 1/4 cup Canola Oil
    • 4 Stale Corn Tortillas cut into 1 cm squares and dried out
    • 1 cup Salsa of your choice
    • 1 Avocado cut in half, pitted, peeled, cut into 1/2 inch slices
    • 2 tbsp Cilantro chopped
    • 1 Lime sliced into wedges  
Instructions
    1.  In a bowl, whisk the eggs, sour cream and salt until well combined.
    2.  Warm the oil in a nonstick pan over high heat until it is hot but not smoking. Drop a piece of tortilla into the oil and listen for a sizzle. When you hear it, add the rest of the tortillas and stir them with a wooden spoon. They will soften as they soak up oil, and then turn crispy. Right after this happens, discard the excess oil and turn the heat to low.
    3.  Add the egg mixture to the pan and scramble together with the fried tortillas. Taste and add more salt if needed. Serve immediately, topped with salsa, sliced avocado, and chopped cilantro. Spritz with lime.
