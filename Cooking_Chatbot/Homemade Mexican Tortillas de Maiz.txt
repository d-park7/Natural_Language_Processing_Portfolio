Ingredients
    • 2 cups Masa Harina (Masa Flour)
    • 1.5 cup Water
    • 1/4 tsp Kosher Salt  
Instructions
    1.  In a medium bowl, combine the masa harina, water and salt and mix well. Continue adding water 1 tbsp at a time until you have formed a soft smooth and thick dough that has the consistency of cookie dough.
    2.  Form 12 golf ball-sized balls and lay a moist dish towel over them so they don't dry out.
    3.  Warm an ungreased comal or nonstick skillet over medium heat.
    4.  Lay a pre cut sheet of plastic on the bottom of the tortilla press and place a ball of masa on top of the plastic. Place a second sheet of plastic on top of the ball and then squeeze the press firmly so that the dough is sandwiched between the two plates. Open the press and remove the flattened masa, which will be stuck between the two sheets of plastic. Place it on your left palm and use your right hand to peel off the top sheet of plastic. Then flip it over and transfer it to your right hand, so that it rests in your right palm. Carefully peel off the other sheet of plastic, freeing the raw tortilla.
    5.  Gently place the raw tortilla on the preheated skillet. Watch for the edge of the tortilla to begin turning opaque, a signal that it is cooking. When this happens, flip to the other side and let it cook for 30 to 45 more seconds. Using the bottom of a pancake flipper, gently press down on the tortilla until you hear it squeal. Flip it back to the first side and let it cook for a final 30 seconds. After the second flip, it should start to puff up, a sign that all of the water in the masa has evaporated and the tortilla is done.
    6.  As each tortilla is finished cooking, set it in a basket or a deep bowl and cover the growing stack with a dish towel to keep them warm.
