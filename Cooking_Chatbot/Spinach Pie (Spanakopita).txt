Original Printable Recipe Here: Spinach Pie (Spanakopita)
Ingredients:

10 ounces frozen spinach, thawed and well-drained
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 large onions
4 cloves garlic, minced
Salt and Pepper to taste
2 teaspoons fresh nutmeg, grated
Zest of 1/2 lemon
1/2 cup pine nuts, toasted
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese
1 cup feta cheese, crumbled and cubed
4 large eggs
10 sheets phyllo dough
4 tablespoons butter, melted
2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted

Instructions:

In a large cast iron pan over medium high heat, sauté onions and garlic with olive oil until the onions are translucent.  Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and lemon zest.  Remove from heat.
In a large bowl, whisk the eggs until beaten.  Add the sautéed onion mixture, spinach, Parmesan, feta, and toasted pine nuts.  Fold to combine and set aside.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Grease the bottom of a 12″ cast iron pan.  Layer with one sheet of phyllo dough and brush the sheet liberally with butter.  Place another layer of phyllo and repeat this step until you have 5 sheets at the bottom.
Evenly spread the spinach mixture into the prepared pan.  Layer with a sheet of phyllo, again repeating the same layering process until you have 5 layers on top as well.
Brush the top with butter, sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds.  If you need to, trim the sides if the dough is overlapping the pan.  Carefully tuck the sides and bake the pie for 45-50 minutes or until the crust is deeply golden.
Remove from the oven and let cool to room temp before slicing.  Serve and enjoy!
