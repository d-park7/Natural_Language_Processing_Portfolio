1 cup Water
1⁄4 cup Oil
Whole garam masala (1/2 tsp cumin seeds, few black peppercorns, 4 cardamom pods, 4 cloves, 2 black cardamom, 1 stick of cinnamon, 1-star anise, 2 bay leaves)
1 large Onion, sliced
1.5 tbsp Ginger garlic paste
1 tsp Turmeric
1 tsp Red chili powder
1 tsp Coriander powder
1 tsp Garam masala powder
Salt to taste
4 Green chilies
1⁄4 cup Fresh coriander and mint leaves
3⁄4 cup Yogurt
1 cup Tomato puree
2 tbsp Ghee

DIRECTIONS

To begin, wash the rice in water until the water runs clear. Then, soak the rice in water for 20 minutes. Set aside.
Next, turn on the Instant Pot and select sauté mode. Heat 1/4 cup oil in the pot.
Once the oil is hot, add whole garam masala to the pot and fry for a few seconds until it starts to release its aroma.
Then, add sliced onion to the pot and fry until golden brown.
After that, add ginger garlic paste and fry for a minute or until the raw smell goes away.
Add chicken pieces to the pot and fry for a few seconds until they are lightly browned.
Next, add turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder, and salt to the pot. Stir well.
Then, add slit green chilies and fry everything together until the chicken is nicely coated with the spices and starts to release its fragrance.
After that, add chopped fresh coriander and mint leaves, yogurt, and tomato purée to the pot. Stir everything together.Once everything is well mixed, cancel the sauté mode.
Close the Instant Pot lid and turn on high pressure mode for 3 minutes. After 3 minutes, do a quick pressure release. Open the lid and check the consistency of the gravy. If it’s too thick, add some water. It should be of a gravy-like consistency.
Now, add soaked rice and 1 cup water to the pot, making sure all the rice is under the liquid. Close the lid and turn on high-pressure mode for 5 minutes. Once the cooking is complete, let the pressure release naturally for 5 minutes.
Open the lid and add ghee, fresh coriander leaves, and mint leaves to the pot. Fluff the biryani with a fork.
Finally, serve the biryani hot with raita or your favorite side dish. Enjoy!
