How to prepare Beef Quesadilla:
1. Marinate the beef in cumin, paprika, chili powder, marjoram, garlic, and 2 tablespoons of oil. You can marinate the beef the day before or at least 30 minutes before cooking.
2. Fry the meat with onions on high heat to colour and transfer to the slow cooker (you can use a pot or leave it in the same pan as well) add stock to cover the meat and add one tsp of salt. Set the slow cooker on high setting for 3-4 hours (for overnight cooking, keep the beef in larger pieces and set on low setting)
3. While the beef is cooking, fry the sweet peppers on medium heat for about 10 minutes, and set them aside for later.
4. When the beef is tender, remove it from the slow cooker, and let it cool for a few minutes in the cooking juices. Then, remove it from the liquid, and shred it with your fingers. Mix the shredded beef with the fried sweet peppers, chopped parsley, tomato paste, chipotle paste and some of the meat cooking juices.
5. Brush one side of the tortilla with olive oil and place it on a heated frying pan. Add cheese to one side and top with the shredded beef mixture. Once the tortilla is golden-brown, fold it over and flatten slightly.
6. Remove the quesadilla from the pan and cut it in half before serving. Enjoy with your favourite Mexican toppings! Enjoy!
