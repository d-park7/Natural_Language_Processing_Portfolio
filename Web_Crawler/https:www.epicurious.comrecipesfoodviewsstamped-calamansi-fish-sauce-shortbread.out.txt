whether it’s soy sauce in chocolate chip cookies or bagoong in caramels, these elements help to balance the sweetness of desserts.
i remember my auntie rina used to dip apple slices in patis, or fish sauce, so i’ve never been a stranger to pairing the condiment with fruit.
with these shortbread cookies, the hint of patis in the glaze really amplifies the lemon-lime notes of the calamansi.
this recipe was excerpted from 'mayumu' by abi balingit.

lightly flour a rolling pin and your work surface.
take one of the dough balls and plop it on your work surface.
roll dough out until it’s ¼ inch thick.
make sure to pick up the dough and occasionally sprinkle some flour between rolls, so it doesn’t stick.

using a pastry brush, coat the surface of each cooled cookie with the glaze.
let the glaze harden for at least 30 minutes before serving the cookies.
store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.
