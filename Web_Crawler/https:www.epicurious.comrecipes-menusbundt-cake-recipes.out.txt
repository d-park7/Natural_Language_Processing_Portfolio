by  the editors of epicurious march 7, 2023 bundt cake recipes rarely require any decoration; the pan alone is enough to make an  easy cake  into a showstopper.
but once you have a  bundt cake pan  (whether it’s classic or more elaborate), you need to pick a flavor profile.
will you go spiced or lemony?
laced with chocolate or a pour of rum?
apple-walnut?
rhubarb-pistachio?
or something that isn’t quite cake but still looks the part, like a peanut-buttery mix of cereal, pretzels, and other snacks, or a towering pile of brioche balls.
below you’ll find our 31 favorite bundt cake recipes, including all that and more.
