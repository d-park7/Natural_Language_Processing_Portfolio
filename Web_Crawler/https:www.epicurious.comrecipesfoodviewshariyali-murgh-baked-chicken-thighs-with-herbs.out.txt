elders will touch the head of a child, saying “tere taqdeer mein hariyali bhar ke aaye, tum phoolon phalo”—may you thrive and flourish.
it is a blessing of abundance.
this was one of the first dishes i learned to cook when i came to england, since the butcher in cambridge sold skinless  chicken thighs .
in india, we rarely eat chicken with the skin on; the masalas can penetrate the meat more easily without it.
so, i was surprised to see chicken sold with the skin on it.
i struggled when taking the skin oﬀ until someone told me to use paper towels to grab the skin to pull it oﬀ before cooking.
here, the skinless (but bone-in) chicken is rubbed with a simple herby yogurt marinade, then baked in a roasting pan.
this recipe was excerpted from 'ammu' by asma khan.
