it’s beer.
this chocolate stout cake recipe abides by the principle that when making a  chocolaty dessert , adding a complementary ingredient helps the chocolate shine.
for example,  adding espresso powder to brownies  deepens their flavor without necessarily leaving a distinguishable trace of coffee.
in this recipe for chocolate stout cake, the beer serves a similar purpose.
stout, such as guinness, adds intense moisture to the cake’s layers and offsets the dessert’s sweetness with a touch of bitterness.
for the deepest chocolate flavor, use  dutch-process cocoa powder , which is less acidic than natural cocoa.
the result is supremely rich but balanced cake, layered with a silky, fudgy chocolate ganache.
this exemplary guinness chocolate cake recipe comes from  barrington brewery  in great barrington, massachusetts, where it’s been a mainstay for years.
it yields three layers of cake—enough to make a towering  layer cake  or a two-layer cake plus a batch of  cupcakes .
ingredients 16–20 servings cake 2 cups (4 sticks) unsalted butter, plus more for pans 2 cups stout (such as guinness) 1½ cups dutch-process cocoa powder 4 cups (500 g) all-purpose flour 4 cups (800 g) sugar 1 tbsp.
baking soda 1½ tsp.
diamond crystal or 1 tsp.
morton kosher salt 4 large eggs 1⅓ cups sour cream frosting and assembly 2 cups heavy cream 16 oz.
bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped cake step 1 place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°.
coat three 8″-diameter cake pans with  unsalted butter  and line with parchment paper rounds; butter parchment.
bring  2 cups stout  and  2 cups unsalted butter  to a simmer in a medium saucepan.
add  1½ cups dutch-process cocoa powder  and whisk until mixture is smooth.
remove from heat and let cool slightly.
step 2 meanwhile, whisk together  4 cups (500 g) all-purpose flour ,  4 cups (800 g) sugar ,  1 tbsp.
baking soda , and  1½ tsp.
diamond crystal or 1 tsp.
morton kosher salt  in a large bowl.
using an electric mixer on medium-low speed, beat  4 large eggs  and  1⅓ cups sour cream  in another large bowl to blend.
add stout mixture and beat until combined.
scrape down sides of bowl and add dry ingredients.
beat on low speed until mostly combined.
using a rubber spatula, fold batter just until combined and no dry spots remain.
step 3 divide batter evenly among prepared pans; smooth surface.
bake cakes until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 30–35 minutes.
transfer pans to a wire rack and let cakes cool 10 minutes.
run an offset spatula around sides of cakes to loosen, then invert cakes onto a wire rack; remove parchment.
turn cakes right side up and let cool completely.
frosting and assembly step 4 bring  2 cups heavy cream  to a simmer in a medium saucepan.
remove from heat and add  16 oz.
bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped .
whisk until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth.
chill frosting, stirring occasionally, until spreadable, about 2 hours.
step 5 place 1 cake layer on a cake platter or large plate.
scoop ⅔ cup frosting on top and spread evenly with offset spatula.
place a second cake layer on top; spread top with ⅔ cup frosting.
place third cake layer on top; frost top and sides of cake with remaining frosting.

this recipe yields a lot of cake.
i cut the recipe in half and am baking it in a spring foam pan.
we won't get the layers, but we prefer more cake to frosting ratio.
very excited.
so far so good.
takes longer to bake this way.
it was a lot of fun to prepare!
anonymous 2/7/2022 i’ve made this cake several times and it is always a hit.
this time, i made a smaller cake and used the leftover batter for cupcakes.
the tangy chocolate taste is phenomenal and the ganache is the perfect amount of sweetness to complement the cake.
cc13 chester, va 11/15/2021 tastes good but this recipe make soooo much cake and is ridiculously fragile, two of my layers completely crumbled and the third stuck to the rack when cooling.
the crumbled layers are still salvageable for a trifle i'm making so that's why i'm giving two stars instead of one.
but be very wary if you decide to use this recipe.
poppyrot seattle, wa 5/10/2021 this recipe makes a delicious cake and it can be cut in half.
i gambled on it  because i had half a can of beautiful stout from yesterday.
secretlythecat florida  12/12/2020 the cake is delicious.
i considered cutting down on the sugar because it sounds like way too much, but decided against it and it came out just right.
not too sweet.
i used two 9-inch cake pans and the full recipe fit just fine.
i did not adjust the baking time, but probably should have.
it could have used another few minutes, because it was so moist in the center.
one layer came out of the pan fine and the other fell apart.
still 4 stars because i think another 2 or 3 minutes would take care of it  anonymous 11/26/2020 this cake is delicious, and is replacing the double chocolate layer cake recipe as my to-go chocolate.
moist and flavorful.
as others have noted, it is huge, serves 24 rather than the 12 mentioned in the recipe.
i baked it in four 8" pans and baked 2 at a time.
the second 2 batter filled cake pans held in the fridge for 40 minutes and did not rise less than the first 2. my batter weighed 2830 grams, so about 700 grams per each of the 4 pans (allowing for batter clinging to bowl and mixer paddle).
otherwise i baked as directed.
the stout added complexity rather making the cake taste like beer.
children liked it.
it is a rather fragile cake and not a good candidate for sculpting or carving shapes.
sf_baker san francisco 1/9/2020 this is different from the ka recipe in that the sour cream is more and it calls for soda and the ka calls for powder.
i think the soda will make the cake rise more?
create a less dense cake???
it could be something to bear in mind... especially if putting a fondant over it.
i am making the powder version for a groom's cake.
it has to be strong as i'm doing 4 9" layers and covering with ganache and fondant.
maybe some raspberry buttercream in between.
i'm still working on between the layers... anonymous louisiana 10/22/2019 question: is 4 cups of sugar the right amount for this recipe?
it seems like far too much!
clotherstuff 9/20/2019 this cake is excellent.
i used rogue brewery's seasonal chocolate hazelnut brown nectar.
the amount of batter was perfect for two 8-inch cake pans and one bundt pan.
i didn't make the icing because we ate the cake warm topped with ice cream.
brownieluv portland, or 3/18/2019 6 forks!!!!
is it the best chocolate cake i've ever baked?
yes.
if you love chocolate cake that isn't too sweet but has an incredible chocolate flavor then this is your cake.
every time i find an amazing recipe i call it 'restaurant worthy' and this is one of them.
i made three 8 inch layers and froze 2 of them.
i cut the layer in half and layered it with a chocolate ganache recipe i had.
i made this frosting but i thought if i added some of the beer to it i'd get a different flavor.
what i got was a soupy frosting so i added confectioners sugar.
the frosting complimented both the cake and the ganache filling.
the cake was tall enough to make a worthy dessert without being so tall and overpowering as the pictured cake.
the one layer was heavy enough, i can't imagine keeping all 3 layers together let along when they are cut in half, keeping all 6 layers in line.
i decorated the top of my cake with a bailey's meringue frosting.
the reason i chose this cake is because of the butter and sour cream.
the other recipe i had to choose from had oil and buttermilk.
i would make this cake again and again!!!
codylovestoys florida 12/9/2018 excellent cake - moist, decadent but not cloyingly sweet.
beautiful in its tall simplicity.
easy to make.
i was in charge of contributing the dessert for a thanksgiving dinner.
this is what i made and it was a huge hit.
ckott portland, or 12/9/2018 moist and yummy!
this is now a go-to easy chocolate cake.
used three 9-inch cake pans and, yes, the picture above is not this cake.
i've made the king arthur's version too and the only difference is 2/3 cup less sour cream and vanilla in the ganache.
either way, it's perfect.
meklas tallahassee 11/22/2017 absolutely delicious!
alleventurini milwaukee, wi  9/24/2017 it’s toooo awesome!!!

i used peanut butter stout and then made a peanut butter buttercream frosting.
